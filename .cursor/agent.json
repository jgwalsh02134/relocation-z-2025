  "description": "Cursor AI agent for development, debugging, and optimization of the Relocation-Z-2025 static web app.",
  "instructions": [
    "Understand the project structure: `index.html`, `assets/style.css`, `assets/script.js`.",
    "Reproduce bugs in browser, check DevTools console, and verify DOM/CSS behavior.",
    "Keep JavaScript scoped; avoid leaking globals to `window`.",
    "Maintain responsive layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop.",
    "Optimize performance and accessibility; run Lighthouse and ensure good Core Web Vitals.",
    "Preserve print-optimized CSS and semantic HTML.",
    "If adding tooling (ESLint/Prettier/Vite), keep changes minimal and opt-in with separate commits."

  "setup": [
    "Ensure Python 3 (for dev server) and Node.js v18+ (for scanner) are installed.",
    "No dependencies to install; site is static.",
    "Optional: run quick scan with `node scripts/scan.js` to catch missing assets/syntax issues."

  "guidelines": [
    "Ensure interactive features (selectors, calculators, Chart.js) remain functional.",

    "Check keyboard accessibility and ARIA where applicable.",
